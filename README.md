Tools Used: Microsoft Excel (Data Validation, Remove Duplicates, Pivot Tables, Pivot Charts, Slicers)
Project Description:
This project involved an end-to-end analysis of a bike sales dataset using Excel. I cleaned and prepared the raw data by removing duplicates and applying data validation, then built an interactive dashboard to visualize key customer demographics and purchasing trends. The dashboard enables dynamic filtering by marital status, education, and region to uncover actionable insights into bike-buying behavior.

Key Steps & Skills Demonstrated:

Data Cleaning: Used the Data Tools menu to remove duplicates and ensure data integrity

Data Quality: Applied Data Validation to maintain consistent data entry standards

Data Analysis: Created Pivot Tables to analyze customer income, age brackets, and commute distance

Data Visualization: Built interactive charts and implemented slicers for dynamic filtering

Dashboard Creation: Designed a user-friendly interface to present key business insights
